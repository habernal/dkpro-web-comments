                    I'm a new member so I need to get some points going and I wanted to start a
                    debate that is a controversial. Religion is such a taboo subject when it comes
                    to negativity that you almost feel bad suggesting such comments. I do however
                    think that when a child comes into the world, it can be raised and taught
                    anything based on what the parents think is correct. When religious parents
                    raise children to suppress open-mindedness thinking and teach that god is real
                    and you must go to church and you must pray every night, so and so on, that
                    child as it matures into an adult may struggle to deal with what they have been
                    taught, as opposed to what they logically think based on the real world in which
                    they live.
                    <br>I see people today that are grown men and women who live solely in the
                    spiritual world, and they cannot take the view that god may not be real as their
                    entire life as a christian has been spent worshipping Jesus and god. Mentally I
                    think it is bad to teach creativity, gods, noahs ark, jonah living in a big fish
                    etc to young impressionable children and I'd support any move to remove
                    religious teachings from schools.

                    I never thought about religion as child abuse, this is a very provocative
                    perspective. I could see it as a minor form of mental child abuse, yet, it's no
                    different than other mythology that is tandard procedure for most parents. For
                    instance, easter where a rabiit layts eggs, a tooth fairy will give you a prize
                    for a fallen tooth, santa claus, halloween, "columbus" day, etc etc. My wife's
                    parents were protestant however since high school, she became a non follower of
                    any religion and adopted high moral attitudes based on common sense, self
                    improvement etc, being Jahmaican she also adopted some of the positive traits of
                    Rastafarism. My parents were Southern Baptists but were not very strong with
                    their convictions, by the time I was 12 or 13, I knew I didn't concur with
                    christianity of any type so when I was 16, I became a member of the N O I,
                    Nation of Islam, like Macolm X, it didn't take long for me to realize there's
                    was something not right about it so at 19 I became a Universal Muslim, While in
                    college I became a deist and after meeting my wife adopted her outlook of
                    theology.
                    <br>
                    <br>We raised our son and daughter without any mythology or religion, instilling
                    in them from adolescene to respect others who with different viewpoints and
                    never to criticize them for believing in myths or being religious. Both of our
                    chiuldren never got in trouble, they have high moral views, are honest, ethical,
                    succesful, have both married and are raising their children like we raised them.
                    So religioon, god, faith and or mythology does not make the child, it is the
                    upbringing. i've seen more children from religious homes-in particular xtians
                    homes and P T-preacher's kids have more issues than among any of our
                    acquaintences who are atheists, deists or any other non religious forms<br><br>

                    <br> Thanks for the rebuttal, too bad your arguement is typical of a deluded
                    christian. Your correct on one point though, my parents didnt teach me religion
                    and that is a wonderful thing. You see, I cannot understand why christians need
                    'God' to teach them morals. Don't you think that we as humans couldnt sit down
                    and say 'You know what? Maybe we shouldn't kill each other or steal each others
                    stuff.' You shouldn't need a God to determine the difference between right and
                    wrong, in fact I would say that God is immoral. The amount of killing he orders
                    in the old testament is cruel beyond belief. It is not moral for an innocent man
                    (Jesus) to be executed for the sins of others. The mere fact that you can cast
                    your sins or wrong doings onto someone else and let them pay the price is not
                    moral. YOU are responsible for your sins, jesus or anybody else cannot take away
                    your accountability. Nor should they offer to. Children need to understand
                    responsibilty and accountability. Do not teach them you can pray and be saved.
                    Do not teach them that if they do not believe in Jesus they will go and burn in
                    hell for all eternity. This is an awful thought. If mature adults want to search
                    out Jesus for thier own consolation, thats fine. But leave the children out of
                    it. You don't do them any favours by teaching them that god created the earth
                    six thousand years ago, when the Earth has existed for millions of
                    years.<br><br>

                    <br> Thanks for your comments. The definition of Delusion is - 'A fixed false
                    belief that is resistant to reason or confrontation with actual fact' and yes I
                    would say that does apply to the Christian Faith. The last rebuttal I had was
                    from someone that was making no sense and was purely spouting god speak from the
                    hip and rambling about discipline. This kind of delusional speak is common
                    amongst the religious, and it is unfortunately passed down to their children, to
                    the undefended mind of the young. Discipline can be taught without God. Fact. If
                    I look at your particular arguement you seem to be suggesting that just because
                    you have been raised by Christian parents and have no issues, that should then
                    cancel out all the unfortunate children who are now adults seeking 'exit
                    counselling' as they come to terms with the fact that they cannot believe what
                    has been fed to them by their parents all their life and maybe it is - just.
                    not. real.
                    <br>'What do I suggest we teach our kids?' Well, What I don't think we should be
                    teaching is the bible as truth, when there is not a shred of evidence to suggest
                    any of it is real. 90% of scientists today agree we have followed evolution by
                    natural selection. Personally, I lean towards this. However, I think that the
                    burdon of proof here lies with you. You are arguing that its ok to teach
                    bronze-age myths to children as real, give them false hope, that there is indeed
                    an afterlife. Would you care to explain to me how it is you know this to be
                    real? Because if you cant prove to me that god exists and you go to heaven or
                    hell when you die, then it shouldn't be taught to children. Don't tell them the
                    ridiculous story about adam and eve and the talking snake. Or the virgin birth,
                    noahs ark, immaculate conception, or the burning bush.
                    <br>By the way, its not a sacrifice if you are executed and killed as Jesus, and
                    then 3 days later risen from the dead to be God. Please don't tell me that is
                    moral or loving to execute someone with a blood sacrifice to forgive the world
                    from sin. Only a sadistic character would order such a thing (and this relates
                    to my point about the old testament) because if god is real why did he not just
                    say 'Ok I forgive you all'. Why torture and crucify yourself to achieve this?
                    Thats not moral no matter which way you try to defend it. Considering also that
                    he planned and wanted this to happen, that makes it even more odd. You see, if
                    you are going to try and defend your statement you really need to stop sitting
                    on the fence and choose a side. You either believe in god or you dont. If you
                    do, then you need to explain to me how its not child abuse to feed children
                    wicked stories about hell, devils, demons, death, torture, fire. You seem to
                    like the position of saying IF god is real. Well so far there is no evidence of
                    that, so perhaps you should have a think about that considering it seems that
                    your parents raised you as a christian to believe in Jesus, and by the nature of
                    your arguement you dont seem to follow that with much conviction.<br><br>

                    <br> The bible is a history book, a collections of anecdotes of he occurences of
                    its time, many of its people and events are based on reality. However just as in
                    any history or accounts of the past, there is hyperbole and embelishments as it
                    is written by the victorious. The bible is not complete, there are many "books"
                    missingas there are many edited and altered over the centuries by various
                    ecumenical councils that were held
                    <br>
                    <br>There was a flood in the area.of Mt Arawat, but it wasn't a world wide
                    flood, there is geological evidence to suggest the parting of the Red Sea which
                    in reality was the Reed Sea, a volcano eruption, followed by a tsunami from
                    Italy that flowed across the Mediterranean causing the "parting" I take the OT
                    as being more accurate than the NT<br><br>

                    <br> Seeing as you think that it is solely parenting that is the issue here and
                    not religion, shall we then discuss the suicide bombers we have in the world
                    today, that are so completely brainwashed that they will walk into a building
                    full of people, bombs strapped to bodies and blow themselves and innocent people
                    into dust. Shall we take September 11 as an example, of religious muslims flying
                    planes into buildings and killing innocent people of the premise that if they do
                    gods work that they will receive 21 virgins in heaven? You have to be completely
                    brain washed from a child to have the delusion that good would come from this.
                    It would only take one of these people who truely feel they are carrying out
                    gods wishes to get his hands on a nuclear bomb and we could have a potential
                    disaster on our hands. There is no end to how far a religious fanatic will go
                    and as I keep trying to explain here, it is because of childhood indoctrination
                    on children we have these worldwide problems to begin with. Religion has caused
                    huge bloodshed, and it starts in the home, with the parents instilling these
                    un-qualified stories in childrens heads. What we teach our kids in school is
                    Science and evolution is part of that. Science is based on truth, logic, and
                    reason.
                    <br>Science tries to prove disprove any theory and if it stands up to this then
                    it is deemed as fact. Religion is the opposite. You are expected to believe
                    everything you are told without a scrap of evidence, and I ask you to show me
                    the evidence you say exists for the claims in the bible. Give me just one
                    example of evidence of something out of the bible, (bearing in mind the bible
                    was written hundreds of years AFTER the christ died).
                    <br>The gospels themselves are written by characters who didnt even know Jesus.
                    They also cannot agree on what each of them is saying, and they have zero
                    accounts of any of Jesus' life when he was a teen.
                    <br>I dont think you should say IF god is real if your a true believer for my
                    benefit. It just suggests fence sitting to try to garner an edge for your
                    apologetic arguement. Finally, how on earth could you POSSIBLY know whether
                    Jesus called have called in angels to save him. Good Greif - this is exactly the
                    reason why children should not be taught religion. Its these types of outrageous
                    claims that back up my point. If you were the only one walking around saying
                    that, you would be deemed as mentally ill. Its purely due to the fact you share
                    the same delusion as all the other religious of the world that you can get away
                    with it. Its not mentally healthy to have a personal relationship with an
                    imaginary friend who you think has a plan for just you. There is no possible way
                    you could know what happens after you die anymore than the rest of us. By the
                    way, if you were born in the days of the vikings you would be believing int
                    Thor. Three thousand other Gods before Jesus were born of virgins, and share the
                    same characteristics of the Jesus story. Jesus is just the most recent god. Its
                    all a story im afraid, a man made story. Only man could come up with such a
                    story full of holes and no evidence to back up the claims.<br><br>

                    personally an eyeball grow into an empty socket after we prayed for the woman to
                    receive healing".
                    <br>
                    <br>Can you show me where I can find evidence of this wonderful miracle? I am
                    fascinated! Surely, there will be recorded evidence of this online, such an
                    amazing miracle could not have been forgetten or not recorded.
                    <br>
                    <br>As for quoting scripture to say that Angels were at the ready to come rescue
                    Jesus, well that can go in the category of childrens bedtime stories with Noahs
                    Ark, Jack and the Beanstalk and friends. Do you really think that the bible is
                    evidence to stand behind such bold statements? You weren't there at the time I
                    gather. So your only going on a book that was written by men. Thats right, by
                    men. Just like me. And look at the stories I could tell you and you may possibly
                    believe them if I wrote a book and told you that God had told me to write it.
                    <br>
                    <br>Children will no doubt be adversely affected by things in the world, you
                    cant escape that. Also your right, any parent can instill their will on a child
                    of whatever they want. But when the bible is taught to children as fact, in
                    schools, when its not, thats bad. Thats not going to help us discover our own
                    existance or medicines cures for disease, we owe these benefits to science.
                    Leave the bible out of schools, and dont scare your children with devils,
                    demons, judgement days, fire and brimstone. Awful.

                    think the fact that it has been written hundreds of years after Jesus died by
                    four different authors who never knew him, or agreed on things such as the
                    virgin birth (a major part of the story) something you want to believe 100%? I
                    wouldnt, and we shouldnt teach such hearsay to children either.
                    <br>
                    <br>"My experience with that miracle was when I was a part of the In Ministry
                    Training program with Victory Bible Institute of Oklahoma, while on a mission
                    trip in rural parts of Mexico's jungle. Though we did not video record that
                    event, miracles are being performed everyday."
                    <br>
                    <br>Well, there you have it ladies and gentlemen. Another amazing claim of a
                    miracle and not a shred of evidence to back it up. Isnt just always the way,
                    ghosts, Ufo's, Nessie and miracles. Never any evidence, funny that.
                    <br>
                    <br>"If God parted the skies and dropped a book it would be no different if He
                    held a hammer over our heads and said choose me or else. God wants us to come to
                    Him in love not fear"
                    <br>
                    <br>God indeed does hold a hammer over our heads and demands us to love him or
                    else. Whats in store for me if I dont love him? Hell fire and eternal torture -
                    Awesome, I cant wait. You do not have a choice, you must love this god or else,
                    there can be no other way. Christians love to be able to 'save' people, because
                    they think that God will wreck his vengeance on those who do not accept him.
                    This is taught to children, jealousy and terror tactics.
                    <br>
                    <br>If religion is so bad that you think it's child abuse, then I would've
                    thought that you'd be a better person for not being taught it. But all I see is
                    hate and attacks, this kind of dishing out your own propaganda isn't something
                    I'd want to teach my children. We should be focusing on solving the hate in this
                    world, the hunger, the suffering. Find our own worth and meaning, as limited as
                    it is.
                    <br>
                    <br>Ill start this by repeating what I said at the start. If you become an adult
                    and search out Jesus for your own consolation thats fine. I dont think that
                    impressionable children should be brought up to be 'A christian child' - they
                    should be a child of christian parents. The child should be able to make up its
                    own mind on religion, not have it indoctrined into them on the basis of no
                    evidence. Moral and religious education, and especially the education a child
                    receives at home, where parents are allowed to determine for their children what
                    counts as truth and falsehood, right and wrong, should not be allowed to cripple
                    a young childs mind by exposure to other peoples bad ideas - no matter who these
                    people are. Parents have no god given licence, to enculturate their children in
                    whatever ways they personally choose; no right to limit the horizons of their
                    childs knowledge, to bring them up in an atmosphere of superstition, or insist
                    they follow the paths of their own faith.
                    <br>Children have a right to not have thier minds filled with nonsense, or
                    taught about a literal truth of the bible.
                    <br>I thank my own parents for taking the view that children should be taught
                    not so much WHAT to think, but HOW to think. If, after having been offered all
                    the scientific evidence, a child grows up and decides that the bible is
                    literally true or that the movements of the planets rule thier lives, then that
                    is thier priviledge. The important point here is that is THIER priviledge, to
                    decide what they shall think, and not thier parents priviledge to impose it by
                    force. And this, is especially important when we reflect that children become
                    the parents of the next generation, in a position to pass on whatever
                    indoctrination they have been subjected too.
                    <br>Its not my own propoganda, nor is it a hate attack, it is simply a
                    passionate response to what is a cycle that must be broken.<br><br>

                    Once I was talking to my stepfather while we were both in the car driving home,
                    and asks me about my friends. I told them that one of them is not having a Bat
                    Mitzvah because she's having a giant argument with her mother about her
                    religion. She wants to become Agnostic, but her mother says no. My stepfather
                    agrees with her mother. He says that when you're a child, you have to do what
                    your parents tell you.
                    <br>
                    <br>No, it's like I didn't know that. Of course I know that you must be obedient
                    to your parents at all times. But not this way, you're forcing your child to
                    believe in something they don't want to? Now to me, that's much similar to what
                    they do in Saudi Arabia, in that: It's absolute ludicrous. Why must you strip a
                    child of their religion, and make them think a certain way. Well, ladies and
                    gentlemen, religious control has been going on for over thousands of years now.
                    <br>
                    <br>Dating back to the Roman Empire, and especially in China and most religious
                    schools, there was religious control. It was/It's like a form of brainwashing.
                    The person or group who invented where you taught people about the world as
                    certain way, and only that way, and not letting them even poke into the outside
                    world, is the most ingenious thing I think I've ever heard of. So, technically,
                    the Pope is one of the most powerful people in the world. Catholicism is the
                    most prominent form of Christianity. So for the Pope, it's like he's controlling
                    his own Empire, however scattered in different parts of the world, multiplying
                    each day. And to me, like I had mentioned earlier, that's the most brilliant
                    thing I've ever heard of.<br><br>

                    <br> Hi I am also a new member.., okay...so? didn't your parents teach you about
                    religion , didn't they taught you that your life comes from God., didn't they
                    told you that , every time , you have to do good . See , religion connects us to
                    God , connects us to our father , I have a cousin, both parents are pastors , I
                    am non catholic, but based on my prior knowledge about your topic , as children
                    grow through the teachings of Christ , they learn , they get ideas on what is
                    wrong and what is right , see , the stories of Noah's Ark, Jonah , etc. shows
                    not only the belief in God but also the different characteristics and behaviors
                    one could get from this story . My point is , religion is ''NOT'' child abuse ,
                    instead , it is the real key , a parent want for their child's future, bright
                    future. One of your point there is that ,when a child grows to maturity into an
                    adult , they may struggle or have a hard time , on what have been taught to them
                    . You know ? , if the child won't struggle , won't learn , won't apply their
                    ideas , their life would be very miserable , because there is no guidance, there
                    is no ''discipline'', you may say, that discipline is one of a person's main
                    enemy, but if there is no discipline , that person may be the enemy , he may do
                    negative acts, because of lost of control , or abuse of freedom. Without our
                    parent's teachings about religion, we now don't know on where we are heading to,
                    are we heading to God and to our bright future or to the other path , on where
                    our end is.<br><br>

                    <br> "When religious parents raise children to suppress open-mindedness thinking
                    and teach that god is real and you must go to church and you must pray every
                    night, so and so on, that child as it matures into an adult may struggle to deal
                    with what they have been taught, as opposed to what they logically think based
                    on the real world in which they live."
                    <br>
                    <br>I was born and raised in a Christian home, praying and going to Church, and
                    I still do. Yet I do not struggle nor have problems with thinking logically on
                    this "real world" in which I live.
                    <br>Just because you have met some "Christians or other religious" people that
                    have grown up with problems, doesn't mean that every kid does. Plus there are
                    plenty of people grown up in homes without religion that end up screwed up in
                    the head too.
                    <br>
                    <br>What do you suggest we teach our kids? What goes on in the world in the here
                    and now only? What about after death? Do you just teach them there is nothing?
                    How is that in of itself not a belief? Is that not another form of faith? Since
                    we don't know what happens to us outside of what the bible teaches?
                    <br>So tell me then, how did my parents not do me any favors by teaching me what
                    they did?
                    <br>I understand the world around me just fine. I understand science and even
                    other religions. I see no evidence to prove or disprove God, no evidence to
                    prove or disprove evolution, so how is taking one out of schools more beneficial
                    then taking out both? What will you do if you were to find out that evolution
                    was wrong?
                    <br>
                    <br>"deluded christian"? Is labeling people with condensing remarks a better
                    alternative to "Christian morals"? Was that what you were taught?
                    <br>I do not believe you need God to teach you morals, but I don't see it
                    harming people either.
                    <br>I don't want to come across as cold, but your lack of understanding of the
                    bible, the old testament, and why God did what he did, negates you from being
                    able to judge God by saying "God is immoral."
                    <br>Look up the debate "God is unjust" and see what I've written there if you
                    would like to learn what non-denominational Christians believe.
                    <br>And no we don't believe the world was created only six thousand years ago. I
                    realize this is a common misconception that even some faiths have come to
                    believe, but this is not true, and not biblical either.
                    <br>IF God is true, then according to the bible he created everything and
                    established a Law for all to live by. Mankind broke this law and God being Holy
                    and Righteous had to punish Mankind. For the wages of sin is death. But because
                    He so loved the world that He sent Jesus to become a sacrifice for our sins so
                    that we might be saved. This was done willingly by Jesus to fulfill the law.
                    That is not immoral, it is the greatest act of Love.
                    <br>It in a way is no different for the Government to send troops to war and die
                    for the protection of you and your loved ones. And if you think that war is
                    immoral and we are wrong to participate in it, then when we are invaded and all
                    our freedoms are taken away, then I'm sure you'd change your mind.
                    <br>
                    <br>If you are indeed so open-minded, then you should be willing to learn about
                    the various religions and try to understand them before shooting them down and
                    labeling those that are in it, deluded.<br><br>

                    <br>
                    <br>Yeah? I can say the same thing about non-christians in my school. And it
                    would be true. For what is one thing in one place is not going to be the same in
                    another.
                    <br>I do agree that it is the upbringing that will help or harm a child in how
                    they are successful in life, but this in no way is related to whether you teach
                    Christian teachings or not.
                    <br>I was a military child and moved around every three years, in both the
                    united states and in foreign countries. I've lived in military housing and
                    civilian housing. I've had new friends almost every year and I've known many
                    Christians and non Christians that have both grown up with good values and
                    morals and have been successful, (thanks to FB in letting me reconnect with most
                    of them) and I've know both sides that have grown up broken and had their life
                    in shambles.
                    <br>I myself went through a rough time, getting divorced once and I experienced
                    misery for a time. But Jesus gave me the strength to get back on my feet, and
                    through my trust in Him I found my success. I'm happily married again, to the
                    most amazing Christian woman, and have a gorgeous little girl now.
                    <br>My Christian upbringing didn't fail me when I went through a hard time, it
                    helped me hold on and gave me understanding to allow me to forgive and move on.
                    <br>I was never hindered in my thinking of the world and understand everything
                    around me, I was encouraged to learn all about it, because then nothing will
                    shake my faith.<br><br>

                    <br> And that is better behavior to teach your children to do over teaching
                    Christian values of waiting till marriage?
                    <br>I waited and it was worth it to me for my first experience.
                    <br>Plus I showed respect for women, where many had none for themselves.
                    <br>That is why the phrase "chivalry is dead" is becoming more popular.
                    <br>The way I see it, if a girl is willing to give it up before a strong
                    commitment, what's to stop her from giving it away to someone else while she's
                    with you?
                    <br>Also you stated that you were married and had kids.
                    <br>What if she told you "oh yeah I had sex with that guy and that guy... before
                    you." how would you still feel about that?
                    <br>I don't like it, but of course I will forgive and move on, but still, I
                    wouldn't like it. And that is what you did to those girls and their future
                    husbands.
                    <br>So you know more examples of religious people not raising there families
                    right, so what? I know plenty of pastor's daughters that waited for marriage
                    too. I have attended many Churches and have witnessed both behaviors in Pastor's
                    kids.
                    <br>It still comes down to instilling proper values in your child, like my
                    parents did with me.
                    <br>Your argument doesn't build your case very well.<br><br>

                    <br>I am not saying that, You should perhaps re-read what I wrote again. I am
                    saying that it has nothing to do with religion, only the way parenting is
                    conducted. Even Christian parenting for some can be done wrong.
                    <br>
                    <br>However you are saying that just because some Christians are now needing
                    "exit counseling" that all parents should not teach Christianity.
                    <br>
                    <br>And then you speak of evolution as a fact because there are supposedly "90%"
                    of scientists believe it to be true and that there is no shred of evidence to
                    suggest God is real.
                    <br>But you obviously don't know the facts because then you would know that
                    evolution was and still is a theory. Meaning that it too has not been proven.
                    <br>So by your own logic, IF God can't be proven, then we should not teach it to
                    children, then we should also not teach evolution, theoretical science, and a
                    number of other topics.
                    <br>
                    <br>I know what I believe to be real based on personal experience with my
                    relationship with God. Meaning that I experience something more tangible than
                    anything in this world, that you could never understand until you've experienced
                    it yourself. And if you ask any true believer, they will tell you the same
                    thing.
                    <br>
                    <br>Plus I have the ability to look at everything in this world, every
                    scientific theory, mathematics, and physics, just like everyone else and I can
                    make my own determinations. I went to public schools, public colleges, just like
                    any other.
                    <br>
                    <br>As far as your argument about Jesus and sacrifice, like I said, until you
                    decided that you want to open your mind and learn something real about it, then
                    all your spouting is in ignorance.
                    <br>
                    <br>I said IF God is real for your benefit, I believe He is real. That should've
                    been obvious.
                    <br>
                    <br>There is no evidence and there never will be. BECAUSE if there was, then
                    there would be no free will to choose God. You would choose Him out of fear and
                    not love, it would be the undoing of His plan.
                    <br>
                    <br>Your only argument I have seen to support your claims is that "some"
                    Christian kids grew up and are now are screwed in the head. But how can you
                    claim that when there are plenty of screwed up 'NON CHRISTIAN" kids too? Seems
                    the common denominator is not religion but parenting. Is this not true? Or am I
                    the only one that can see proper logic?
                    <br>
                    <br>And one more note. Jesus could've done two things, He could've called the
                    angels to save Him, or He could've fled before it happened. For He knew it ahead
                    of time that His death will be soon. The fact that He didn't is the reason why
                    it became a sacrifice.
                    <br>
                    <br>So perhaps you'd like to learn a little about what your talking about before
                    you try and tell someone who does believe in it, how it is.
                    <br>
                    <br>What is ironic is that people seem to think that Christians are the only
                    ones pushing our beliefs on to others, like somehow we are the only ones capable
                    doing this. <br><br>

                    <br> That is true and I agree with that. My point wasn't on what to do after
                    your together while both not being virgins, but on the fact that you used women
                    for sex before and then left them for what ever reasons. And I was asking is
                    that better parenting for your parents to teach you lack of respect for women
                    over Christian teachings of sex is sacred and should be done only through
                    marriage?
                    <br>
                    <br>Here is another question. If you think forcing religious beliefs on your
                    child is abuse, how is it any different than forcing any thing on your child
                    because you think its right? Some adults have dropped out of school and still
                    became very successful. Like Shawn Parker, whom created Napster and then joined
                    Face book. So would it be wrong for you to force your child to go to school?
                    What about forcing your child to eat their peas and green beans because you deem
                    them healthy? Though it is proven that you can live without them.
                    <br>If you can rule that religion is child abuse, will you rule that homosexuals
                    having children is as well?
                    <br>Due to forcing their way of life on "young impressionable minds", though
                    nature intended otherwise?
                    <br>What about other objects that leave impressions on children, like TV or
                    games? It can then be just as easily arguable that games inhibit the child to
                    learning the "real world" and many end up shrugging of marriages and their
                    children because of their addiction to it. In fact this is the reason why I had
                    to quit WOW and grow up and take care of my family, because I had started
                    becoming consumed with it.
                    <br>Where will you stop and draw the line?
                    <br>If a wican wants to teach satanism to their child, I being Christian may not
                    like it, but I won't oppose their parenting rights. But I also don't see why
                    anyone would need "exiting counseling" like the other person stated.
                    <br>It is not that hard for a child to decide that they don't want to follow in
                    their parents footsteps, this is evident all around us.
                    <br>People loose faith in what ever the believe all the time, that doesn't mean
                    they are damaged or unable to cope.
                    <br>
                    <br>It all comes down to proper parenting regardless of what you believe or
                    don't and how you prepare you child for the future. Proper communication is the
                    major key to any successful relationship. Open mindedness is the key to
                    understanding the world around us. Proper Christian teaching will teach to not
                    hate and to learn and understand others. If Christian parenting doesn't
                    communicate and teach open mindedness, then I see that child failing in life,
                    unless outside sources can teach them to understand new things and allow them to
                    make up there own mind. Same goes for non-religious teaching families.
                    <br>
                    <br>This is a debate about whether religion is child abuse, so I say no for
                    reasons above.
                    <br>"Why xtian values? why not just good old common sense moral values without a
                    thelogical twist?"
                    <br>This is not a debate about why religious people think that they are right
                    about their faith.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>I am not asking schools to allow the preaching of Jesus and salvation as a
                    course study, I just want an alternative view to evolution and "there is no God"
                    teachings.
                    <br>It can be as simple as, Creationism is the idea of a god or intelligent
                    designer created everything and the bible is their book. They can teach all
                    other religious views too.

                    <br> victorious?

                    son, once dedicated christian killer, and many others, then ok.
                    <br>I know that there is more books that didn't make it into the bible. But
                    edited and altered? no. the method of passing down information was very strict
                    for coping the bible. As was proof with the dead sea scrolls.
                    <br>Also the Reed sea and volcano/tsunami business is just some geologist trying
                    to justify events so that they aren't as miraculous as the bible makes them to
                    be. But that wouldn't explain how they walked on dry ground, or how the seas
                    parted in the short time it took Moses to raise his staff.
                    <br>These are stories about a God that can do great things. It is a faith that
                    you can choose to believe or not. Simple as that.

                    <br> Yes you have to be brainwashed, was it the religion or the person teaching
                    hatred that is to blame?
                    <br>Ask any normal Muslim if the extremist are doing the work of their god, they
                    will say no. The jihadist are twisting the religion and using it as a means for
                    their own ends. Parents, teachers, mentors, whom ever is giving the influence to
                    the child is to blame, not the method in which they use. For instance, what
                    about the various murderers and serial killers that has no connections to any
                    religious affiliations? It still comes down to people.
                    <br>
                    <br>In want evidence for the bible, go look up the debate "God is unjust" and
                    see what I've written there.
                    <br>
                    <br>All your assumptions and facts on the bible and their authors are also
                    wrong. Look things up first.
                    <br>
                    <br>You give no explanation to why people of no faith, also grow up screwed in
                    the head, that have committed great acts of violence and hate, your completely
                    one sided and this one sided thinking is usually a cause of hatred. You need to
                    re-examine all people around you and in this world.
                    <br>Just because you don't like or can't possibly believe the stories you've
                    heard about Christianity (though you should do your own research and not just
                    hear say) you have become the person that "child abused" (mentally damaged or
                    whatever) that you are claiming others to be.

                    <br> "Finally, how on earth could you POSSIBLY know whether Jesus called have
                    called in angels to save him. Good Greif - this is exactly the reason why
                    children should not be taught religion."
                    <br>
                    <br>Really? Try reading the bible first.
                    <br>If Jesus during the temptation that Satan put him through; "Then the devil
                    took Him into the holy city; and he had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple,
                    and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God throw Yourself down; for it is
                    written, 'He will give His angels charge concerning You'; and 'On their hands
                    they will bear You up, Lest You strike Your foot against a stone." Matt 4:1-11
                    <br>
                    <br>If Jesus could do it then why wouldn't He be able to do it later?
                    <br>
                    <br>"Good Grief"?
                    <br>Let me ask you this then. Since you seem to believe that God doesn't exist,
                    since you state God as imaginary, you must believe that nothing happens after
                    death. You simply just do not exist anymore. What is the point then to
                    everything? No matter how good or bad you live your life, there is in fact
                    ultimately no meaning to anything. Would you agree with that?
                    <br>All things will eventually pass away, even this world, when our sun dies.
                    <br>So whats the point?
                    <br>Would it not be child abuse then to teach that there is a point?
                    <br>If our lives has no meaning, then we should simply live out our short life
                    span, indulging in every possible pleasure. And to teach to do anything else
                    other than to what our selfish desires are is then abuse too right?
                    <br>To try and argue that it is better to have morals and live right so that we
                    don't harm others, is still pointless.
                    <br>In fact, atheist, science, medicine, love, caring, it is all pointless, if
                    we should believe your views.
                    <br>Just as you want to claim religion as child abuse, because we should not
                    force children into our beliefs, we can say forcing our children to do anything
                    against their will is abuse.
                    <br>You want to play games, but any expert in psychology will say that faith in
                    God is different then having imaginary friends. Just because you don't see a
                    billion dollars or a dinosaur, doesn't mean that they never existed. If you are
                    willing to believe that anything you haven't seen in today's world does exist
                    based on eye witness testimonies of others, then their is no reason why
                    Christians can't believe the eye witness testimonies given to us in the bible.
                    <br>And since faith offers hope and purpose and imaginary friends do not, it
                    would be insane for anyone to actually compare them together.
                    <br>
                    <br>And as far as no evidence and full of holes. Again you are speaking out of
                    ignorance.
                    <br>I have never seen miracles happen from any other religion, but I have seen
                    personally an eyeball grow into an empty socket after we prayed for the woman to
                    receive healing.
                    <br>The bible is full of these eye witness testimonies too. And there is plenty
                    of outside of the bible sources that talk about Jesus and his miracles too.
                    <br>
                    <br>The reason I don’t get into debate about topics like “Is the war in Iraq
                    wrong?” is because I don’t have the information that the generals and advisors
                    have that has been classified as top secret. If I did have that information then
                    I would have an opinion on rather it was wrong or not. Thus to state an opinion
                    on something that I wouldn’t have the full facts on would become an argument of
                    ignorance, unless I state that I’m willing to be wrong and learn otherwise.
                    <br>Same goes for people that don’t read the full bible in its proper context
                    and take the proper time to see what the scholars say about it. They too end up
                    miss-using quotes out of context and making blanketed statements as if they are
                    fact on subjects they are not fully aware of.

                    <br> "Do you really think that the bible is evidence to stand behind such bold
                    statements?"
                    <br>
                    <br>Look, do you think your the first person to make these claims, or tried to
                    disprove the stories or rationalize them away? The bible stands today just as it
                    always has. If there was easily definable proof, or logic, or any form of
                    rationalizations that could baffle the religious professors, pastors, scholars,
                    then it would've already come out. As it stands no question has to yet to be
                    unanswerable by the Christian community.
                    <br>
                    <br>What sounds like a fairy tale to me is atheists that believe in science and
                    medicine, but have no belief in the afterlife of any kind. When the brain dies,
                    they cease to exist. How is that not meaningless?
                    <br>
                    <br>I believe science will show more and more of an intelligent designer and
                    will give just enough to look for Him, to come to Him by faith. The two will be
                    mutual not separate.
                    <br>
                    <br>My experience with that miracle was when I was a part of the In Ministry
                    Training program with Victory Bible Institute of Oklahoma, while on a mission
                    trip in rural parts of Mexico's jungle. Though we did not video record that
                    event, miracles are being performed everyday. In various Churches, on the
                    streets, in remote tribes, in the prisons, ect... Where ever there are missions
                    being conducted, God is performing miracles. You can see them on Christian TV
                    and find them online. This is not a secrete the Church has been hiding. If you
                    want to find them you can. Whether you choose to believe them or try and justify
                    or rationalize them away is up to you.
                    <br>
                    <br>Its funny that you think that just because something was written by men that
                    it can't possibly be true in the realm of religion. If God parted the skies and
                    dropped a book it would be no different if He held a hammer over our heads and
                    said choose me or else. God wants us to come to Him in love not fear. The bible
                    had to be written by men. That doesn't mean it wasn't God inspired.
                    <br>
                    <br>I never said I wanted bible taught in schools. If you can have evolution, as
                    misguided as it is, taught in schools, then we can have intelligent designer
                    taught as well. We don't need our faith taught or salvation, we just want the
                    alternative to evolution. We don't even care if all religions got a part taught
                    in school. Or better yet, we should just cut it all out, including evolution. Or
                    make it an elective that people can choose to take or not.
                    <br>
                    <br>If no god and the brain just dies and we no longer exist, meaning our life
                    is meaningless in the end. that is just as awful.
                    <br>
                    <br>If religion is so bad that you think it's child abuse, then I would've
                    thought that you'd be a better person for not being taught it. But all I see is
                    hate and attacks, this kind of dishing out your own propaganda isn't something
                    I'd want to teach my children. We should be focusing on solving the hate in this
                    world, the hunger, the suffering. Find our own worth and meaning, as limited as
                    it is.<br><br>

                    <br> "Well, there you have it ladies and gentlemen. Another amazing claim of a
                    miracle and not a shred of evidence to back it up. Isnt just always the way,
                    ghosts, Ufo's, Nessie and miracles. Never any evidence, funny that"
                    <br>
                    <br>Nice cynicism...
                    <br>
                    <br>What's funny is that you fail to mention the part in your re-quoting of me,
                    of where I told you that you can find documented evidence on any number of
                    Christian websites or see it in any Church, or Christian TV.
                    <br>What's also funny is that you fail to respond to my questions and statements
                    on kids who grew up in non christian homes that turned out to be psychos,
                    murderers, and other degrees of whack jobs.
                    <br>
                    <br>What's funny is that somehow you still believe a religion is responsible for
                    child abuse, as if a gun can fire itself and not a person pulling the trigger.
                    <br>
                    <br>You keep mentioning that christian kids that learn about the real world end
                    up needing "exiting counseling" but you have not brought any evidence of this
                    either. I certainly have never heard of this before, anyone who looses faith in
                    what they were taught just move on, they quit going to church, they just
                    continue on with there life.
                    <br>
                    <br>I was taught many things as a child besides religion and I still have the
                    "PRIVILEGE" to think for myself and decide what I want to believe, because....
                    wait for it... I'm a thinking human....
                    <br>
                    <br>Propaganda is a form of communication that is aimed at influencing the
                    attitude of a community toward some cause or position so as to benefit oneself
                    or one's group.
                    <br>So yes it is your propaganda and it will never be broken because it is
                    ridicules, because you can't give actual evidence to your claim or even personal
                    testimony. Because you fail to reply appropriately and you continue to try and
                    twist, misquote, and misunderstand what others have written to you.
                    <br>For instance:
                    <br>
                    <br>"God indeed does hold a hammer over our heads and demands us to love him or
                    else. Whats in store for me if I dont love him? Hell fire and eternal torture -
                    Awesome, I cant wait. You do not have a choice, you must love this god or else,
                    there can be no other way. Christians love to be able to 'save' people, because
                    they think that God will wreck his vengeance on those who do not accept him.
                    This is taught to children, jealousy and terror tactics. "
                    <br>
                    <br>I do not and will not tell people they have to do this or else. If others do
                    then they have been taught wrong. Jesus did not do this, neither will I. I made
                    that clear before and the message of the bible isn't about that at all. Yet you
                    continue to spout it anyways.
                    <br>Plus the fact that you don't know and can't prove God is real is evidence
                    enough that there is a choice. You can only come to God by faith.
                    <br>If you don't believe in any of this then why does it matter so much to you?
                    Did some christian "hurt" you?
                    <br>If you don't like religious people pushing their faith on people then ignore
                    it. I don't cussing and people using Jesus name in vein, but it happens all the
                    time anyways. I just ignore it.
                    <br>
                    <br>And I also thank my parents for teaching me about God and the bible, and
                    manners, and free thought, and respect for others, and disciplining me when I
                    did wrong.
                    <br>
                    <br>It is the parents job to impose many things by force. Just because you feel
                    you don't need to go to school or eat your peas or get a job, it's still
                    important for parents who care to force you to do things sometimes.
                    <br>And when the child grows up and moves out then they decide to do whatever
                    they want. It's ridiculous to think that parents that teach religion aren't
                    teaching their kids "how" to think. Perhaps you haven't learned this lesson
                    quite so well?<br><br>
